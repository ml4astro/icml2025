# Rationale

As modern astrophysical surveys deliver an unprecedented amount of data, from the imaging of billions of distant galaxies to the innermost region of supermassive blackholes, the integration of AI into scientific workflows, which have stringent accuracy requirements, becomes increasingly crucial to exploit the full information content of these datasets. In addition, the multimodal and publicly accessible nature of astronomical data creates a fertile development ground for large scientific models, with applications far beyond astronomy. 

Following successful iterations of this workshop at [ICML 2022](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2022/) and [ICML 2023](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2023/), our continued goal for this workshop series is to **bring together Machine Learning researchers and domain experts in the field of Astrophysics** to discuss key opportunities, create new synergies and help promote the large-scale application of AI for science. We expect this workshop to appeal to ICML audiences as an opportunity to connect their research interests to concrete and outstanding scientific challenges.

We welcome in particular submissions that target or _report on_ the following non-exhaustive list of problems:

- Foundation models for astrophysics and their (potential) impact on discovery 
- Integration of LLMs and agents in scientific workflows
- Efficient high-dimensional Likelihood-based and Simulation-Based Inference
- Robustness to covariate shifts and model misspecification
- Anomaly and outlier detection, search for rare signals with ML
- Methods for model interpretability
- (Astro)-physics informed models, symmetry and equivariance-preserving models
- Deep Learning for accelerating numerical simulations

We encourage both submissions on these topics with an astrophysics focus, as well as more methodologically oriented works with potential applications in the physical sciences.

To further drive meaningful progress in the field, we are introducing this year a **new dedicated Benchmark Track**, inviting contributions that establish rigorous, insightful, and consequential benchmarks aligned with any of the workshopâ€™s core themes. The goal is to encourage benchmarks that not only measure performance but also provide actionable insights into real-world applicability and impact. Submissions will be rigorously evaluated by an expert panel, with a strong emphasis on the validity of benchmark metrics as proxies for real-world success.
