# Rationale

As modern astrophysical surveys deliver an unprecedented amount of data, from the imaging of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies to the mapping of cosmic radiation fields at ultra-high resolution, conventional data analysis methods are reaching their limits in both computational complexity and optimality. Deep Learning has rapidly been adopted by the astronomical community as a promising way of exploiting these forthcoming big-data datasets and of extracting the physical principles that underlie these complex observations. This has led to an unprecedented exponential growth of publications combining Machine Learning and astrophysics. Yet, many of these works remain at an exploratory level and have not been translated into real scientific breakthroughs.

Following successful iterations of this workshop at [ICML 2022](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2022/) and [ICML 2023](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2023/), our continued goal for this workshop series is to **bring together Machine Learning researchers and domain experts in the field of Astrophysics** to discuss the key open issues which hamper the use of Deep Learning for scientific discovery, and to present high-quality and cutting-edge work at the intersection between machine learning and astrophysics.

An important aspect to the success of Machine Learning in Astrophysics is to create a two-way interdisciplinary dialog in which concrete data-analysis challenges can spur the development of dedicated Machine Learning tools, which this workshop aims to facilitate. We expect this workshop to appeal to ICML audiences as an opportunity to connect their research interests to concrete and outstanding scientific challenges.

# Call for Abstracts

We welcome submissions that target or _report on_ the following non-exhaustive list of problems:

- Efficient high-dimensional inference
- Robustness to covariate shifts and model misspecification
- Anomaly and outlier detection, search for rare signals with ML
- Methods for accurate uncertainty quantification
- Methods for improving interpretability of models
- (Astro)-physics informed models, symmetry and equivariance-preserving models
- Methods of emulation / acceleration of simulation models
- Benchmarking and deployment of ML models for large-scale data analysis
- Foundation models and LLMs for scientific discovery
- Generative models for astrophysical data

We encourage both submissions on these topics with an astrophysics focus, as well as more methodologically oriented works with potential applications in the physical sciences.

## Important Dates
