# Rationale

As modern astrophysical surveys deliver an unprecedented amount of data, from the imaging of billions of distant galaxies to the innermost region of supermassive blackholes, the integration of AI into scientific workflows, which have stringent accuracy requirements, becomes increasingly crucial to exploit the full information content of these datasets. In addition, the multimodal and publicly accessible nature of astronomical data creates a fertile development ground for large scientific models, with applications far beyond astronomy. 

Following successful iterations of this workshop at [ICML 2022](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2022/) and [ICML 2023](https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2023/), our continued goal for this workshop series is to **bring together Machine Learning researchers and domain experts in the field of Astrophysics** to discuss key opportunities, create new synergies and help promote the large-scale application of AI for science. We expect this workshop to appeal to ICML audiences as an opportunity to connect their research interests to concrete and outstanding scientific challenges.

We welcome in particular submissions that target or _report on_ the following non-exhaustive list of problems:

- Foundation models for astrophysics and their (potential) impact on discovery 
- Integration of LLMs and autonomous agents in scientific workflows
- Efficient high-dimensional Likelihood-based and Simulation-Based Inference
- Robustness to covariate shifts and model misspecification
- Anomaly and outlier detection, search for rare signals with ML
- Methods for model interpretability
- (Astro)-physics informed models, symmetry and equivariance-preserving models
- Deep Learning for accelerating numerical simulations
- Benchmark datasets aligned with any of the above themes

We encourage both submissions on these topics with an astrophysics focus, as well as more methodologically oriented works with potential applications in the physical sciences. Submissions focusing on preliminary work and recent work submitted elsewhere are also welcome.

# Venue

ML4Astro 2025 will be held in the **Victoria Learning Theatre, Room 182 in the [Irving K. Barber Learning Centre](https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/buildings/irving-k-barber-learning-centre-iblc/)**.

**Accessibility**: the Victoria Learning Theatre is on the ground floor of the IBLC building, down a half flight of stairs. There is a mobility-accessible entrance on East Mall. Accessible and gender-inclusive single stall washrooms are located on levels 1, 3, and 4. See [IBLC's access guide](https://services.library.ubc.ca/facilities/disability-access-by-building/access-guide-ikblc/) for more details.

Getting there:
<br>
**Public transit**:
>- Routes from downtown Vancouver: Bus lines 004, 014, 044, and 084 each run every 12-15 minutes from various departure locations downtown. You can also take the metro (use the Canada Line) to an express bus (099 or R4). Metro trains and express busses arrive every ~5 minutes.
>- Paying: At Skytrain stations and on buses, you can pay easily with your contactless credit or debit card as well as with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.
>- Route planning: Google Maps is up to date with Vancouver's public transit network and can reliably be used to work out your route. Vancouver's Skytrains and buses have automated audible and visual bus stop announcements onboard.
>- Cost: UBC and downtown Vancouver are in the same zone (Zone 1), total fare each way is $3.35 CAD.


**Taxi/Rideshare**: Lyft and Uber are available in Vancouver. Due to ongoing construction, it is best to direct your driver to drop you off at the [Robert. H Lee Alumni Centre - 6163 University Boulevard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Robert+H.+Lee+Alumni+Centre/@49.2673046,-123.2526421,650m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x548672b6360dff9d:0x82fa3ec0bf22ed35!8m2!3d49.2659289!4d-123.2500243!16s%2Fg%2F11b6gd5f15!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYyMy4yIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). From there, the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre is a 5 min walk. Cost: ~$40 each way.


**Parking**: The closest parking is the [North Parkade - 6115 Student Union Boulevard](https://parking.ubc.ca/map). Cost: $20 CAD for the day.

Lunch options:
* Coffee and snacks will be provided at the start of the meeting and for the morning and afternoon breaks, but attendees will need to bring or procure their own lunch.
* There are many options a short walk away from Irving K. Barber along University Blvd, including within the student centre (the "Nest").
* See [UBC's list of restaurants and food courts](https://visit.ubc.ca/eat-drink-and-stay/restaurants/) for ideas.
