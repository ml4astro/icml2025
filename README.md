# ML4Astro Workshop, Co-Located @ ICML 2025, July 20th

As astrophysical datasets swell in scale and complexity, integrating AI into scientific workflows has become critical to unlock their full potential. Building on our successful ICML 2022 and 2023 editions, this workshop aims to connect ML researchers and astrophysicists to advance AI methods for discovery, inference, and understanding in the physical sciences. We invite submissions on topics including: 

* Foundation models
* LLMs and agents for science
* Likelihood-based inference
* Robustness
* Rare signal detection
* Interpretability
* Physics-informed modeling
* Simulation acceleration
* Aligned benchmarks
